# 🛡️ SOC Dashboard (The "Hollywood Hacker" Edition)

Welcome to the SOC Dashboard, a project designed to answer the age-old question: _"Can we make cybersecurity look like a sci-fi movie?"_

Spoiler: **Yes.**

This is a frontend-only simulation that looks incredibly important but is actually just random numbers and cool CSS. Perfect for putting on a second monitor to intimidate your coworkers or convince your boss you're "tracking APs in real-time."

## 🚀 Features (or "Distractions")

- **Cyberpunk Aesthetics:** Because `#ffffff` background is for accountants. We use `#0a0c10` and neon lights.
- **Live Threat Map:** Totally simulated. That "attack" coming from Antarctica? Probably a penguin with a flipper zero.
- **"Matrix" Terminal:** Prints fast-scrolling logs that mean absolutely nothing but look cool.
- **Zero Backend:** 100% client-side. No databases were harmed in the making of this dashboard.
- **Welcome Banner:** Validates your existence as an "Analyst" every time you refresh.

## 🛠️ Installation (The Boring Part)

1.  **Clone it:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/soc-dashboard.git
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:** (Download half the internet)
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run it:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  **Profit:** Open `http://localhost:3000`, wear sunglasses, and type loudly.

## 🐛 Known Issues

- The "AI Analyst" might technically just be a bunch of `if/else` statements. Shhh.
- If you stare at the neon too long, you might start seeing code in the real world.
- Pressing keys harder does not actually increase hacking speed.
